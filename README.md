This is a repository for my personal github pages site. Currently it is partially finished with a resume section and projects section, and much of the information is out of date, but it will be updated again in the future when I have more time :). For the time being, in addition to the outdated resume/portfolio, I am using the site to host a research report on IT industry certificaiton for one of my final BASc classes.
